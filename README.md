# Text-To-Speech 
# How to use
## Steps :

1. Open your preferred code editor and create a new Python file.

2. Copy and paste the code from above into the Python file.

3. Save the Python file with any name of your choice, but ensure it has a ".py" extension.

4. Install the win32com module by running "pip install pypiwin32" on your command prompt or terminal.

5. Run the Python script you just created in your terminal or command prompt by navigating to the directory where the Python file is saved and typing "python      filename.py" (replace "filename" with the actual name of the file).

6. Once the program starts running, input the text you want to be pronounced when prompted.

7. To exit the program, type "q", and the program will use text-to-speech to say "thanks for using".

Note: Ensure that you have speakers or headphones connected to your computer so that you can hear the text being pronounced.
